# Ping Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Ping Pong" using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The game allows two players to control paddles on opposite sides of the screen and compete against each other by hitting a ball back and forth.


## Instructions

Run the code using a Python interpreter.

The game window will open with a black background.
Player A (right side) can move their paddle up and down using the Up and Down arrow keys.

Player B (left side) can move their paddle up and down using the W and S keys.

The objective of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle and prevent it from touching the edges of the screen behind the paddle.

Each time the ball touches the right edge behind the paddle controlled by Player A, Player B scores a point.

Each time the ball touches the left edge behind the paddle controlled by Player B, Player A scores a point.

The game continues until one player reaches the winning score.
The current score of both players is displayed at the top center of the screen.

The game window can be closed by clicking on it.
## Components

Scoreboard: Manages the scoring system and displays the current score on the screen.

Ball: Represents the ball in the game, controls its movement, and handles collision with the walls and paddles.

Paddle: Represents a player's paddle, allows it to move up and down on the screen.
## Dependencies

The code relies on the turtle module, which is a part of the Python standard library. Therefore, there are no additional dependencies to install.
## Limitations and Possible Improvements

1.The game is a basic implementation and lacks advanced features like different levels of difficulty, power-ups, or multiplayer over a network.

2.The game window has a fixed size of 800x600 pixels, which may not be suitable for all screen resolutions. Adding an option to adjust the window size could improve the user experience.

3.The paddles and the ball are simple shapes without any visual enhancements. Adding custom graphics or animations could make the game more visually appealing.

4.The game does not have a proper start or end screen. Enhancing the user interface with menus, game over messages, and a play again option would provide a better overall experience.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your requirements or add new features to make the game more engaging and enjoyable. Happy gaming!
